It is proposed in [TSMixer: Lightweight MLP-Mixer Model for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09364.pdf) by IBM Research authors `Vijay Ekambaram`, `Arindam Jati`, `Nam Nguyen`, `Phanwadee Sinthong` and `Jayant Kalagnanam`.\n","\n","For effective mindshare and to promote opensourcing - IBM Research joins hands with the HuggingFace team to opensource this model in HF.\n","\n","In this [HuggingFace implementation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/patchtsmixer), we provide PatchTSMixer’s capabilities to facilitate lightweight mixing across patches, channels, and hidden features for effective multivariate time series modeling. It also supports various attention mechanisms starting from simple gated attention to more complex self-attention blocks that can be customized accordingly. The model can be pretrained and subsequently used for various downstream tasks such as forecasting, classification, and regression.\n","\n","`PatchTSMixer` outperforms state-of-the-art MLP and Transformer models in forecasting by a considerable margin of 8-60%. It also outperforms the latest strong benchmarks of Patch-Transformer models (by 1-2%) with a significant reduction in memory and runtime (2-3X). For more details, refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09364.pdf).\n","\n","In this blog, we will demonstrate examples of getting started with PatchTSMixer. We will first demonstrate the forecasting capability of `PatchTSMixer` on the Electricity data. We will then demonstrate the transfer learning capability of PatchTSMixer by using the model trained on the Electricity to do zero-shot forecasting on the ETTH2 dataset.\n","\n","`Blog authors`: Arindam Jati, Vijay Ekambaram, Nam Ngugen, Wesley Gifford and Kashif Rasul\n","\n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","1. Demonstrate the use of the recently contributed Hugging Face model architectures for forecasting use-cases, including pre-training and fine-tuning.\n","\n","2. Illustrate how to perform transfer learning from a pretrained model, with various approaches for fine-tuning the model on a target dataset.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"F832Jq1iAGZN"},"source":["\n","## PatchTSMixer Quick Overview\n","\n","<div> <img src=\"./figures/patch-tsmixer-arch.png\" alt=\"Architecture\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/></div>\n","\n","\n","`PatchTSMixer` begins by splitting a given input multivariate time series into a sequence of patches or windows. Subsequently, it passes the series to an embedding layer, which generates a multi-dimensional tensor.\n","\n","\n","The multi-dimensional tensor is subsequently passed to the `PatchTSMixer` backbone, which is composed of a sequence of [MLP Mixer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601) layers. Each MLP Mixer layer learns inter-patch, intra-patch, and inter-channel correlations through a series of permutation and MLP operations.\n","`PatchTSMixer` also employs residual connections and gated attentions to prioritize important features.\n","\n","\n","<div> <img src=\"./figures/backbone_illustration.png\" alt=\"Mixing\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/></div>\n","\n","A sequence of these MLP Mixer layers like the above is used to construct the `PatchTSMixer` backbone. `PatchTSMixer` has a modular design to seamlessly support masked time series pre-training as well as direct time series forecasting.
